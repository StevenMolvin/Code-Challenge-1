Project Title: WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE
Description:
This challenge is about practicing programming with JavaScript merged with HTML5 and CSS. 
I have achieved this by implementing the use of a HTML, CSS and JavaScript file.
By creating a HTML file with appropriate tags, linking it with the CSS file which has a bit of styling for the background of my HTML and also a JavaScript file that uses DOM manipulation to enable interaction of the HTML elements complete with Control flow, functions and object methods.
