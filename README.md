Project Title: WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE
Description:
This challenge is about practicing programming with JavaScript merged with HTML5 and CSS. 
I have achieved this by implementing the use of a HTML, CSS and JavaScript file.
By creating a HTML file with appropriate tags, linking it with the CSS file which has a bit of styling for the background of my HTML and also a JavaScript file that uses DOM manipulation to enable interaction of the HTML elements complete with Control flow, functions and object methods.  

Setup:
    1. For the first system functioning of grading students based on their mark, I used JavaScript elif control flow to output the grade of the user's percentage marks input appropriately. I passed this funtion as a parameter on an event listener method linked to a button element on a html file. The button shows the user a message containing a grade equal to the percentage mark input in the html form element.

    2. For the second function of a speed test, I used JavaScript if control flow to pop an "Ok" message if the speed input value is within the speed limit, award a point for every 5km/hr gained and suspend the license if garners more than 12 points.

    3. For the third function of calculating the Net Salary, PAYE, NHIF and NSSF deductions, I used Javascript if control flow to work out the PAYE tax and NHIF deductions and the (*) operator to work out the NSSF deduction.
